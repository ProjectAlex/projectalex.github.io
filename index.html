            <section>
                <h2>Why this topic?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>People nowadays are stuck to their mobiles and other handhelds, reducing the realtime social interaction between peers even when physically present at the same spot.</li>
                    <li>Since people nowadays are addicted to their gadgets and donâ€™t let go of themselves, we aim at using these very gadgets to get them closer. </li>
                    <li>We want to bring back the concept of these old board games and spruce it up with digital features. </li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Literature Survey</h2>
                <ul>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>The Game</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The game is an adaptation of "Snakes and Ladders" and "Scene it"</li>
                    <li>The game can be played by as many players as we want.</li>
                    <li>A question appears on the screen, and all the participants are supposed to answer the question</li>
                    <li>If a person seems to be doing well in one particular field, the questions would be from some other field. (Machine Learning)</li>
                    <li>The question will be a combination of pictures, videos, audio clips in various topics to exploit the fact that the game is digital.</li>
                    <li>The first person to reach the finish point is declared winner.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>For eg. </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>For a 5 player game if 3 people answer the question quicker than the player playing his hand he moves 2 spaces ahead, or if he is the first to answer he moves 5 spaces ahead. </li>
                    <li>This keeps all the players engrossed as they are constantly interacting with the game.</li>

                <h2>Existing Solutions and Problems</h2>    
                <ul>
                    <li>Google's Chromecast is not opensource and thus does not give enough flexibility.
                    <li>PiCast runs on a raspberry Pi and allows devices to content stream over WiFi. It is priced similar to the chromecast making it economically feasible. Devices communicate with PiCast using an API. It supports only Videos, Audio, Images like Chromecast</li>
                    <li>Another device we considered was Roku Stick which uses DLNA to stream content and can be plugged into any HDMI compatible TV.</li>

            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Challenges we face</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Speed - The connection speed may cause problems during gameplay.</li>
                    <li>Maximum number of players the server can handle will be a limiting factor.</li>
                    <li>Should be interconnected using WiFi</li>
                    <li>Fluctuations in speed and connections</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>How do we plan to tackle <br />the challenges</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The game must be tweaked according to the connection speed that is achievable. For eg a turn based game for a slow connection or a fast everyone-plays multiplayer game if the connection is fast enough</li>
                    <li>The upper limit for number of players should be set based on the servers capability and the game that is chosen</li>
                    <li>The app must be able to work under a wobbly connection allowing players to reconnect and continue and not get kicked out</li>
